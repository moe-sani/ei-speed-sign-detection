Speed Sign Detection With Edge Impulse on OpenMV Camera
Learn how to build your own AI speed sign detection system using Edge Impulse and an OpenMV camera. We'll walk through the entire process:
● Importing and labelling a road sign dataset
● Training a machine learning model with Edge Impulse (including tips for improving accuracy)
● Deploying the model to an OpenMV camera
● Displaying the detected speed limit on an LCD screen
This project is perfect for beginners interested in AI and embedded systems. You don't need any prior experience, just a desire to learn! Plus, the entire project runs on the device, so you don't need to worry about cloud costs or internet connectivity.
